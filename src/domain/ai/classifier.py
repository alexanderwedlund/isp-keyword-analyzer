Please classify the following sentence as either:
- 'AA' (Actionable Advice): Sentences that contain sufficient information to act upon without any ambiguity.
- 'OI' (Other Information): Sentences that are ambiguous, too abstract, or lack specific instructions.

IMPORTANT: Focus specifically on classifying the sentence containing the HIGHLIGHTED KEYWORD in [square brackets]. This is the target sentence you need to classify.

Thoroughly analyze the FULL CONTEXT before making your classification. Context often provides critical clues about whether a statement should be classified as AA or OI.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Actionability: Can an employee take concrete, specific actions based solely on this information? AA requires clear direction on what to do or not do.
2. Clarity: Is the instruction clear enough to be followed without significant interpretation? (Note: Not every detail needs to be spelled out as long as the required action is clear)
3. Contextual relevance: Does the surrounding context modify how the statement should be interpreted?

Guidelines:
- Actionable Advice (AA): Specific, unambiguous instructions that employees can directly implement without interpretation. 
Examples: "Passwords must not be given over the phone", "Read e-mail that does not need to be saved should be deleted"

- Other Information (OI): This includes:
1. Ambiguous instructions (e.g., "orders must be submitted to IT in good time" - "good time" is subjective)
2. Vague guidance (e.g., "all staff must exercise caution when using e-mail" - doesn't specify how)
3. Abstract statements that indicate general direction but aren't directly actionable
4. Strategic statements despite containing relevant keywords

IMPORTANT DISTINCTION EXAMPLE:
- "Do [not] leave sensitive documents visible on your desk when leaving it unattended" should be classified as AA.
  Why? Even though it doesn't specify exactly what constitutes "sensitive documents" or what alternative action to take, it provides a clear, actionable instruction (don't leave documents visible). Employees can immediately understand and follow this directive.

- "Orders must be submitted to IT in good time" should be classified as OI.
  Why? The phrase "good time" is too vague to be actionable. Employees cannot determine when exactly to submit orders, making the instruction unimplementable without further clarification.

The key distinction is whether an employee can take a specific action based on the instruction, even if some details are left to reasonable interpretation.

Keyword being analyzed: {keyword}

FULL CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
Previous sentences: 
{extended_before}

Immediate previous context: 
{before_context}

TARGET SENTENCE TO CLASSIFY: "{highlighted_sentence}"

Immediate following context: 
{after_context}

Following sentences:
{extended_after}

YOUR RESPONSE FORMAT:
First line: Classification (AA or OI)
Following lines: 3-5 sentences explaining your classification in {st.session_state.language} language.

Example response (english language example - your response is in {st.session_state.language}):
AA
This sentence provides clear, specific instructions that can be directly implemented. The keyword [Must] appears in a context that requires definite action. The statement is unambiguous about what employees should do.
